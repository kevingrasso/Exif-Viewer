# Exif-Viewer

# Overview

- **Academic Year**: 2020-2021
- **Student**: Kevin Grasso
- **CFUs**: 9

In this assignment it was implemented an Image and EXIF Metadata Viewer using python. The implementation was made following the paradigm of Model View Controller.

# Requirements

- **Python version**: Python 3.8.3  \[1\]
- **Pyqt5**: Pyqt 5.15.2  \[2\]
- **Pillow**: Pillow 7.2.0  \[3\]


# Summary
I used pyqt5 for the implementation of the interface and Pillow library to retrieve the information regarding Exif Metadata of an image, and to make operations with images, like rotation and resizing.

# Features
- Support visualization of JPEG images, that will be scaled to have a maximum dimension of 512 pixels.
- Visualization of all EXIF tags encoded in the JPEG file.
- Support rescaling of the image with the window scaling.
- Support to rotation of the image in 90Â° increments.

# Extra Features
- Support the Geolocalization, if the image has GPS Geolocation Tags, can click a button which redirects to Google Maps location in your browser.
- Can open multiple images from file selector and switch between them through a button (next and prev).

The model folder contains Models of this project. 
- Model.py contains all the functions to store and manipulate data.
- TableModel.py is the re-implementation of Table Model class to adapt to our exif data to show.

The views folder contains Views of this project. 
- dialog.ui and mainwindow.ui are the interaface created with Qt-designer. 
- Ui_Dialog.py and UiMainWindow.py are automatically generated by Qt Designer, and have been implemented in MainView.py that contains all the functions that manipulate the interface, and makes the calls to the model to retrieve data to show.
